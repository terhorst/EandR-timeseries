== Compilation Instructions == 
This library contains code which implements the recursions described
in Terhorst, Schl√∂tter & Song (2015). A C++11-compliant compiler
(such as GCC 4.8 or higher) is required to build this library.
Additionally, the code depends on the google-sparsehash library
(https://code.google.com/p/sparsehash/). To build the library:

  $ make libcexp.so
  $ make python

The resulting Python shared object file pyexp.so can then be called
using the interface described in pyexp.pyx.

The mathematical equations represented by the files in in include/
are obtained using the Maple script `scripts/3l.mpl'. The script
`scripts/run.py' will generate a shell file which can be used to
re-create these files. The files have been generated for you, so under
normal circumstances you should not need to run this.
