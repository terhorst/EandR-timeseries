== Usage Instructions ==
This archive contains code to perform the likelihood calculations
described in Terhorst, Schl√∂tterer & Song (2015). Those calculations
rely on the Python library `threelocus' which is also included. In
order to execute this code, first build the library on your machine as
detailed in the file `threelocus/README.txt'.

The file `example.py' is example of how to use this library to perform
inference. It analyzes a test data set (also included) in order to test
for estimated the action of selection. Refer to the comments in that
file for further details. Execute `example.py' using the wrapper script
`example.sh' in order to ensure that the threelocus library can be
located on your system.

== Additional Notes ==
This archive contains the source code to the inference model used in
the manuscript, as per PLoS guidelines. Further development, including
bug fixes and a more user-friendly interface, will occur at this project's
GitHub repository: https://github.com/terhorst/eandr-timeseries. Please
check there for additional updates.
